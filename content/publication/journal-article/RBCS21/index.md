abstract: 
  This study showed that -  a) the PPA is promising to train new pedologists since, by mixing theoretical activities and
  contextualized practices (a project in progress), it not only awakens great motivation and critical capacity but also develops
  the ability for apprentices to find solutions in a area in constant evolution; b) the quality of the maps changed
  significantly according to the validation sample design applied. The CSM present better quality than DSM, mainly when using
  SSRS. The RF presented equivalent accuracy to CSM using SRS. Irrespective to validation sample design, the MLR presented the
  lowest accuracy; c) The CSMs presented higher user’s accuracy while the DSMs presented higher producer’s accuracy; d) The
  quality of CSM generated by the apprentices was not clearly related to the previous experience and knowledge in soil science.

summary: The PPA demonstrates relevance in the teaching-learning process of soil mapping.
  Combination of data-driven and expert knowledge methods are advised for future courses.
  Soil mapping using new tools involves multidisciplinary knowledge.
  This course can serve as a guide to meet the needs of PronaSolos
