abstract: 
  The Itatiaia National Park (INP) is a conservation unit, with a multitude of species of the Brazilian fauna and
  flora, some endemic. The INP is the origin  of  12  watersheds  that  contribute  to  the  rivers  Rio  Grande  and
  Paraíba do Sul, important rivers in southern and south regions of Brazil. It  is  one  of  the  parks  that  receive
  most  visitors  in  Brazil  due  to  the  landscape and biodiversity characteristics. The aim of this study was to
  assess the soil vulnerability in the INP by integrating the information of physical environment with knowledge of
  experts, to reconcile demand for  public  use  and  of  ecosystems  conservation.  The  method  used  was  spatial
  application  of  a  probabilistic  model  known  as  Bayesian  Belief  Network  (BBN).  Soil  data  (such  as 
  carbon  content,  texture,  depth,  and  capacity to store water) were integrated with data derived from remote
  sensing  (e.g.  land  use)  and  relief  (elevation  and  slope)  and  with  the  expert opinion of land managers,
  decision makers and researchers that work  with  the  INP  or  surrounding  areas.  Integrating  environmental
  factors  and  expert  opinion  is  a  suitable  approach  to  assess  the  soil  vulnerability in INP. The most
  fragile areas were identified with soils with high levels of carbon, profiles less developed (shallow), with
  accentuated slopes, and a vegetation cover with herbaceous graminoid plants, with a predominance  of  Cyperaceae
  and  Poaceae  (high  altitude  fields).  This  approach   will   help   decision   makers   to   identify   priority
  areas   for   intervention, in order to reduce soil degradation in the areas with high vulnerability. The results
  could also be used as a basis to support the INP management   plan,   as   well   as   to   contribute   to   other
  researches,   especially  those  related  with  ecosystem  services  in  the  Atlantic  Forest  Biome.
