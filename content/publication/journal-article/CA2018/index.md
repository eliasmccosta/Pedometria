abstract: 
  Digital  elevation  models  (DEM)  used  in  digital  soil  mapping  (DSM)  are  commonly  selected  based  on
  measures  and  indicators  (quality  criteria) that are thought to reflect how well a given DEM represents the
  terrain surface. The hypothesis is that the more accurate a DEM, the more accurate will be the DSM predictions. The
  objective of this study was to assess different criteria to identify the DEM that delivers the most accurate DSM
  predictions. A set of 10 criteria were used to evaluate the quality of nine DEMs constructed with different data
  sources, processing routines and three resolutions (5, 20, and 30 m). Multinomial logistic regression models were
  calibrated using 157 soil observations and terrain attributes derived from each DEM. Soil class predictions were
  validated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results showed that, for each resolution, the quality criteria are
  useful to identify the DEM that more accurately represents the terrainsurface. However, for all three resolutions,
  the most accurate DEM did not produce the most accurate DSM predictions. With the 20-m resolution DEMs, DSM
  predictions were five percentage points less accurate when using the more accurate DEM. The 5-m resolution was the
  most accurate DEM overall and resulted in DSM predictions with 44% accuracy; this value was equal to that obtained
  with two coarser resolution, lower accuracy DEMs. Thus, identifying the truly best DEM for DSM requires assessment
  of the accuracy of DSM predictions using some form of external validation, because not necessarily the most accurate
  DEM will produce the best DSM predictions
