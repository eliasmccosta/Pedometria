abstract: 
  The soil organic matter (SOM) content and dynamic are related to vegetation cover, climate, relief, and geology;
  these factors have strong variation in space in the southeastern of Brazil. The objective of the study was to
  compare and evaluate performance of classical multiple linear regressions (MLR) and geographically weighted
  regression (GWR) models to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) and chemical fractions of organic matter in the
  Brazilian southeastern mountainous region. The regression models were fitted based on SOC and chemical fractions of
  SOM. The points (n = 89) were selected by pedologist's experience along transects and toposequences. The covariates
  were also selected using the empirical knowledge of pedologists when choosing variables that drive soil
